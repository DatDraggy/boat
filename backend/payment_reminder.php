Sadly we haven't received the payment for your ticket. Therefore we had to lock your account and invalidate your reservation.
From now on you have 7 days time to send your payment, after that your account will be deleted and you will have to register again.
Keep in mind that you do NOT have a reservation anymore. If you pay, but all slots are taken, your payment won't be accepted.

If you already paid, your account will be unlocked if there are free slots left once the payment is confirmed.

If you have any questions, please send us a message. Reply to this e-mail or contact us via Telegram at https://t.me/summerboat.
