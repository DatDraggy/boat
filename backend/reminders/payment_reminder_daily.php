Sadly we haven't received the payment for your ticket. Therefore we had to lock your account and invalidate your reservation.

Keep in mind that you do NOT have a reservation anymore, meaning that if you pay now but it doesn't arrive in the next 3 days, you will lose your money and not get a registration.

In case you already paid and the payment arrives within 3 days, your account will be unlocked.

If you have any questions, please send us a message. Reply to this e-mail or contact us via Telegram at <a href=\"https://t.me/summerboat\">https://t.me/summerboat</a>.
