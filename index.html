			and we will have a fursuit lounge with basic supplies. Water for suiters is provided, but please don't

                <p>The chance of getting seasick on this boat is very minimal. This is because the speed and the size of
                  the boat make it impossible to feel any waves from other boats on the Spree. We do advise to talk with
                  your doctor in case you get seasick very easily. It will be smooth sailing!</p>
