		  <h4 style="color: var(--colorPrimary)">1 Boat, 2 Parties</h4>
            <p>To be able to accommodate the lot of you comfortably, we have had to extend our program.
			Let’s set sail to the unknown! On the 18th of August, we will go on 2 adventures with our own White Pearl.
			At 13:00 CET we will explore the city of Berlin in search of coin and gold. </p>
			<p>Later that day we will depart from the Estrel at 19:00 CET for an evening party cruise on the wild seas!
			Our wish is to give as many of you a chance to join our trip.
			Therefore attendees may only register for one of the two parties, this is due to high demand. </p>

		  <h4 style="color: var(--colorPrimary)">Location</h4>
            <p>Our vessel of choice, the Mark Brandenburg is the biggest ship of the Stern und Kreis Company.
			With 2 bars, 2 outdoor areas, a fursuit lounge and plenty of space to chill, dance and suit our flagship is the perfect place to start Eurofurence 26! </p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that it is a ship suitable for cities.
			That means that the ceiling is low (around 2 meters high) and the outdoor decks are not always available due to low bridges.</p>
          </div>
		  <div class="ticket ticketQuartery content content33">
		  <h4 style="color: var(--colorPrimary)">Transport</h4>
            <p>The afternoon cruise (Party A | 13:00 CET) will depart from and return to Treptower Park (maps link).
			This is to save time getting to the city center. The boarding location in at Treptower Park is one subway stop away from the Berlin-Sonnenallee subway stop (maps link).
			<!-- [A shuttle bus will be provided for fursuiters, departing from the Estrel hotel at time] -->
			Badge pickup will take place prior to boarding at the hotel. </p>
			<p>The evening cruise (Party B | 19:00 CET) will depart from and return to the Estrel beergarden pier.
			Badge pickup will take place prior to boarding at the hotel.</p>

                  In 2019 some friends wanted to do something special for celebrating the 25th edition of Eurofurence and the 5th edition in Berlin, the city that knows how to party!
				  So why not on a boat? Cruising on the beautiful Spree River through Berlin.
				  We wanted a chill atmosphere for partying and suiting up. The double-decker-ship Mark Brandenburg offered us just that.
				  Live DJs would provide great dance vibes and the upper would allow for alluring views. It did! And now we’re back for more!

				The Mark Brandenburg ist one of this biggest ships out there and the speed and the size of the boat make it impossible to feel any waves from other boats on the Spree.
