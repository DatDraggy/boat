			<h2 id="afternoon" class="headline">Afternoon event</h2>
			<p><strong>General information</strong></p>

			<p>Join us on our White Pearl through the city of Berlin. Starting from Treptower Park, 
			we will be on a 4 hour trip to the center of Berlin and back. 
			Get a drink at the bar and enjoy the sun while listening to our DJ’s. </p>
			<p>Just like the evening party we will have a dancefloor where you can dance all day long. 
			Want to suit up? No problem! The fursuitlounge downstairs is of course also available with all the stuff you need.</p>
			<p>This event is perfect for fursuiters and photographers or for the people who want to start Eurofurence the relaxing way. </p>

			<p><strong>Meet and Greet Berlin</strong></p>

			<p>During the trip we will also have a one hour photo stop in the center of Berlin. 
			Perfect to take pictures in fursuit or to just walk around a bit. 
			The stop will be at the Berliner Dom, next to the museum island. 
			During this stop you are welcome to get off board or stay on the ship.<br>
			<br>
			If you go off board, please read the tips below:<br>
			
			<ul>
			 <li>We won’t wait for you when leaving. Too late is too late. We will announce the exact departure time before docking.</li>
			 <li>Fursuiting near the Dom is possible, but we advice to bring someone with you because it can be busy with tourists and people enjoying the sun.</li>
			 <li>EF Security stays near the ship to make sure that non attendees won’t enter the ship. So please bring your badge with you when going off board.</li>
			 <li>Please head to any of the staff when you have any questions.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Transportation/How to get there</strong></p>
			
			<p>The event will start and end at Treptower Park, next to S-Bahn station Treptower Park. There are different ways to get there.</p>
			
			<p><strong>By public transportation</strong></p>
			
			<p>Walk from the Estrel to S-Bahn station Sonnenallee. 
			From there take the S42 for 1 stop to Treptower Park. This train goes every 10 minutes. 
			At Treptower Park you can follow the signs towards the ship. It will be a 5 minute walk to the pier.  
			For this trip you can buy a Short Trip ticket (Kurzstrecke). 
			A one way ticket costs €1,70.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>By car/taxi</strong></p>
			
			<p>While we prefer that most people come by public transportation cause it’s fast and easy, 
			we also understand that it is not possible for everyone. 
			From the Estrel it is a 10 minute ride to the nearest parking spot next to Treptower Park.
			Navigation address: Puschkinallee 15, 12435 Berlin
			</p>
			<p>Parking is free and it’s a 5 minute walk from the parking to the ship. 
			You can find the parking on the right hand side when you’re almost near the navigation address. 
			There will be a sign for parking Treptower Hafen. <br>
			If you use a taxi, let them drive you to S-Bahn station Treptower Park. From there it is a 5 minute walk.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Shuttle Busses</strong></p>
			
			<p>At this moment we are still looking into the option to get a few shuttle busses from the Estrel to the ship. This will mostly be for the fursuiters. 
			We will update with more info in the coming months.
			</p>
